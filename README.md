# SiqiTool
Personal tool for easier programming

This is just a repository of useful tools for manipulations including file I/O, sort of 
algorithms, data operation and so on. 

I'm continuously updating it, and trying my best to write comments to all the public functions, 
so if you are interested, just download and use the jar file in the release folder.
